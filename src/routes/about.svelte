    <p class="mb-6 text-xl">Welcome N17R hackers!</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-md">If you are newbies in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, here is a quick intro.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-md">CTF is an information security contest in which participants are assigned a certain number of tasks to get into the servers and steal an encoded string from a hidden file. This string resembles sensitive information and is known as a flag. Participants capture these flags using their ethical hacking skills and put these flags into the CTF server.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-md">Points are allotted for each flag as per the difficulty level of the tasksâ€”the higher the difficulty level of the task, the more points you will score. The participant or the team scoring the highest points will be the winner of the CTF event. Many information security communities organize these CTF events.</p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-md">Example of flag: <strong>flag{'{n1ce_flag_haha}'}</strong></p>
    <p class="mb-6 text-md">During CTF, you can do whatever you want: Google, search, copy & paste.</p>
